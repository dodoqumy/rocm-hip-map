# Contributing to ROCm-DS[#](#contributing-to-rocm-ds)

2025-11-04

5 min read time

AMD appreciates and values your interest in contributing to the ROCm Data Sciences (ROCm-DS) stack. This collection of libraries — hipDF, hipGRAPH, hipMM, hipRAFT, and hipVS — is a fork of the RAPIDS® open-source project from NVIDIA and brings high-performance, GPU-accelerated data science, graph analytics, mathematical computation, and vector search to the ROCm ecosystem.

You can contribute in several ways: reporting bugs or requesting new features, improving documentation, performance optimizations, porting functionality from equivalent CUDA-based libraries, writing or improving tests. If you want to contribute to our ROCm-DS repositories, review the guidance below to help ensure your contributions are accepted.

## Development workflow[#](#development-workflow)

The ROCm-DS project uses GitHub to host the code, collaborate within the community, and manage version control. The project relies on pull requests for all changes within the repositories, ensuring that contributions are reviewed and discussed before being merged into the main codebase. This helps maintain code quality and consistency. The ROCm-DS project uses GitHub issues to track bugs, feature requests, and other-project related tasks, providing a transparent and organized way to monitor progress and prioritize work.

### Issue tracking[#](#issue-tracking)

Use the GitHub Issues tab for each project — hipDF, hipGRAPH, hipMM, hipRAFT, and hipVS.

Before opening a new issue, search for existing issues to avoid duplicates. If the issue exists, upvote it and add details or a minimal reproducer.

If you’re unsure whether your issue matches an existing one, file your issue and reference the similar issue number. If it is a duplicate, it will be closed and tracked through the original issue.

When filing a new issue, use the repository issue template.

Include as much context as possible:

ROCm version, GPU model(s), architecture(s), OS and version, kernel/driver versions

Compiler/CMake/Python versions, branch or tag, commit SHA

Exact commands run, logs, stack traces, and a minimal reproducer

Expected vs. actual behavior


Monitor your issue for follow-up as additional information may be needed.

You can also open an issue to ask whether a proposed change meets the acceptance criteria or to discuss an idea about the library.


### Coding style[#](#coding-style)

In general, follow the style of the surrounding code. HIP, C and C++ code is formatted using clang-format.

Also, githooks can be installed to format the code pre-commit:

```
install pre-commit # Install pre-commit into your python environement
cd <REPO_ROOT>
pre-commit install # Install the githooks using pre-commit
```

## Pull Request Guidelines[#](#pull-request-guidelines)

Identify the issue you want to fix

When you create a pull request, you should target the default branch. Our repositories typically use the develop branch as the default integration branch.

For each new file in the repository, include the following licensing header and adjust the date to the current year. When simply modifying a file, the date should automatically be updated when using the pre-commit script.

Ensure your code builds successfully

Each component has a suite of test cases to run; include the log of the successful test run in your PR

Do not break existing test cases

New functionality is only merged with new unit tests

If your PR includes a new feature, you must provide an application or test to ensure that the feature works and continues to be valid in the future

Submit your PR and work with a reviewer or maintainer to get your PR approved

Once approved, the PR is brought onto internal CI systems and may be merged into the component during the release cycle, as coordinated by the maintainer

After your change is committed you will receive notification


## Thank you for contributing[#](#thank-you-for-contributing)

AMD and the ROCm-DS community appreciate your time, effort, and expertise. Every contribution, whether big or small, plays a vital role in making the project better and more impactful to the entire community. Your involvement helps drive innovation, enhance the quality of the software, and ensures the continued success of ROCm-DS. We look forward to collaborating with you and are excited to see the positive changes you’ll bring to the project!
