# Training Llama-3.1 8B with Megatron-LM[#](#training-llama-3-1-8b-with-megatron-lm)

**Authors**: Shekhar Pandey and Liz Li

**Knowledge level**: Intermediate

This tutorial demonstrates how to train the Llama-3.1 model using *mock data*. The Llama-3.1 8B model is a popular open-source large language model (LLM) designed to handle a wide range of natural language processing tasks efficiently. Learn more about the Llama models at [Llama’s website](https://www.llama.com/).

This tutorial uses mock data to provide a quick and lightweight demonstration of the training workflow, enabling you to verify that your environment is correctly configured and functional. Mock data is a useful way to validate the training pipeline without requiring large datasets.

The training process leverages the Megatron-LM framework, a specialized framework for pretraining and fine-tuning large-scale language models. For more information about Megatron-LM, see their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM). All steps are executed within a Docker container, which provides a ready-to-use environment with all necessary dependencies.

This tutorial builds on the setup completed in the [Pretraining with Megatron-LM tutorial](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/ai-developer-hub/en/latest/notebooks/pretrain/setup_tutorial.html).

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites)

This tutorial was developed and tested using the following setup.

### Operating system[#](#operating-system)

**Ubuntu 22.04**: Ensure your system is running Ubuntu version 22.04.

command instead.**Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and configured correctly. Follow the Docker installation guide for your operating system.**Note**: Ensure the Docker permissions are correctly configured. To configure permissions to allow non-root access, run the following commands:usermod -aG docker $USER newgrp docker

Verify Docker is working correctly:

run hello-world


### Hugging Face API access[#](#hugging-face-api-access)

Obtain an API token from

[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co)for downloading models.Ensure the Hugging Face API token has the necessary permissions and approval to access

[Meta’s Llama checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B).

## Prepare the training environment[#](#prepare-the-training-environment)

After your system meets the prerequisites, follow these steps to set up the training environment.

### 1. Pull the Docker image[#](#pull-the-docker-image)

Run the following command in your terminal to pull the prebuilt Docker image. The Docker image provides all necessary dependencies, including PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, ROCm libraries, and Megatron-LM utilities.

```
pull rocm/megatron-lm:24.12-dev
```

### 2. Launch the Docker container[#](#launch-the-docker-container)

Run the following command in your terminal to launch the Docker container with the appropriate configuration:

```
run -it --rm \
--device /dev/dri \
--device /dev/kfd \
--network host \
--ipc host \
--group-add video \
--cap-add SYS_PTRACE \
--security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
--privileged \
--name megatron-dev-env \
-v $(pwd):/workspace \
-w /workspace/notebooks \
rocm/megatron-lm:24.12-dev \
/bin/bash
```

**Note**: This command mounts the current directory to the `/workspace`

directory in the container. Ensure the notebook file is either copied to this directory before running the command or uploaded into the Jupyter Notebook environment after it starts. Save the token or URL provided in the terminal output to access the notebook from your web browser. You can download this notebook from the [AI Developer Hub GitHub repository](https://github.com/ROCm/gpuaidev).

### 3. Install Jupyter and start the server[#](#install-jupyter-and-start-the-server)

Inside the Docker container, install Jupyter using the following command:

```
install jupyter
```

Start the Jupyter server:

```
--ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --no-browser --allow-root
```

**Note**: Ensure port `8888`

is not already in use on your system before running the above command. If it is, specify a different port by replacing `--port=8888`

with another port number, for example, `--port=8890`

.

### 4. Access the Jupyter notebook[#](#access-the-jupyter-notebook)

There are two ways to load your Jupyter notebook:

#### Mount the notebook with Docker[#](#mount-the-notebook-with-docker)

**Ensure the correct mounting**: When launching the container, use the`-v /path/to/notebooks:/workspace/notebooks`

option to mount your notebook directory.**Locate the notebook in the container**: Inside the Jupyter interface, navigate to`/workspace/notebooks`

to find your files and begin working on them.

#### Upload the notebook through the browser[#](#upload-the-notebook-through-the-browser)

**Skip the**: If you prefer not to mount your notebook directory, omit the`-v`

option when launching Docker`-v /path/to/notebooks:/workspace/notebooks`

option.**Upload manually**: After accessing the Jupyter interface in your browser:Click the

**Upload**button in the top-right corner.Select your notebook file from your host machine and upload it to the container.


**Start working**: After the notebook is uploaded, click the notebook filename to open it and begin working.

### 5. Clone the Megatron-LM repository[#](#clone-the-megatron-lm-repository)

Run the following commands inside the Docker container to clone the Megatron-LM repository and navigate to the validated commit:

```
# Clone the Megatron-LM repository and navigate to the validated commit
!git clone https://github.com/ROCm/Megatron-LM && cd Megatron-LM && git checkout bb93ccbfeae6363c67b361a97a27c74ab86e7e92
```

### 6. Provide your Hugging Face token[#](#provide-your-hugging-face-token)

A Hugging Face token can be generated by signing into your account at [Hugging Face Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

You’ll require a Hugging Face API token to access Llama-3.1 8B. Generate your token at Hugging Face Tokens and request access for Llama-3.1 8B. Tokens typically start with “hf_”.

Run the following interactive block in your Jupyter notebook to set up the token:

**Note**: Uncheck the “Add token as Git credential” option.

```
from huggingface_hub import notebook_login, HfApi
# Prompt the user to log in
notebook_login()
```

Verify that your token was accepted correctly:

```
try:
api = HfApi()
user_info = api.whoami()
print(f"Token validated successfully! Logged in as: {user_info['name']}")
except Exception as e:
print(f"Token validation failed. Error: {e}")
```

## Run the training script[#](#run-the-training-script)

This section describes how to run the training script, with an explanation of the key parameters.

### Single-node training overview[#](#single-node-training-overview)

The training process involves running a pre-configured script that initializes and executes the training of the Llama-3.1 model. The script leverages the Megatron-LM framework and mock data to simulate a full training pipeline. This approach ensures your environment is configured correctly and is functional for real-world use cases.

Before running the script, ensure all environment variables are set correctly.
