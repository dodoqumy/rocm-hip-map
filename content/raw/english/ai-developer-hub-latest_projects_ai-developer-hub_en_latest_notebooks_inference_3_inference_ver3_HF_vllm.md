# Deploying Llama-3.1 8B using vLLM[#](#deploying-llama-3-1-8b-using-vllm)

**Authors**: Seungrok Jung and Hyukjoon Lee

**Knowledge level**: Beginner

vLLM is an open-source library designed to deliver high throughput and low latency for large language model (LLM) inference. It optimizes text generation workloads by efficiently batching requests and making full use of GPU resources, empowering developers to manage complex tasks like code generation and large-scale conversational AI.

This tutorial guides you through setting up and running vLLM on AMD Instinct™ GPUs using the ROCm software stack. Learn how to configure your environment, containerize your workflow, and send test queries to the vLLM-supported inference server.

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites)

This tutorial was developed and tested using the following setup.

### Operating system[#](#operating-system)

**Ubuntu 22.04**: Ensure your system is running Ubuntu version 22.04.

### Hardware[#](#hardware)

**AMD Instinct GPUs**: This tutorial was tested on an AMD Instinct MI300X GPU. Ensure you are using an AMD Instinct GPU or compatible hardware with ROCm support and that your system meets the[official requirements](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html).

### Software[#](#software)

**ROCm 6.2 or 6.3**: Install and verify ROCm by following the[ROCm install guide](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/quick-start.html). After installation, confirm your setup using:This command lists your AMD GPUs with relevant details.

**Note**: For ROCm 6.4 and earlier, use the`rocm-smi`

command instead.**Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and configured correctly. Follow the Docker installation guide for your operating system.**Note**: Ensure the Docker permissions are correctly configured. To configure permissions to allow non-root access, run the following commands:usermod -aG docker $USER newgrp docker

Verify Docker is working correctly:

run hello-world


### Hugging Face API access[#](#hugging-face-api-access)

Obtain an API token from

[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co)for downloading models.Ensure the Hugging Face API token has the necessary permissions and approval to access

[Meta’s Llama checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B).

## Prepare the inference environment[#](#prepare-the-inference-environment)

Follow these steps to get the inference environment ready for use.

### 1. Launch the Docker container[#](#launch-the-docker-container)

Run the following command in your terminal to pull the prebuilt Docker image containing all necessary dependencies and launch the Docker container with the proper configuration:

```
run -it --rm \
--network=host \
--device=/dev/kfd \
--device=/dev/dri \
--group-add=video \
--ipc=host \
--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \
--security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
--shm-size 8G \
--hostname=ROCm-FT \
--env HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE=/workspace \
-v $(pwd):/workspace \
-w /workspace/notebooks \
--entrypoint /bin/bash \
vllm/vllm-openai-rocm:v0.15.0
```

**Note**: This command mounts the current directory to the `/workspace`

directory in the container. Ensure the notebook file is either copied to this directory before running the Docker command or uploaded into the Jupyter Notebook environment after it starts. Save the token or URL provided in the terminal output to access the notebook from your web browser. You can download this notebook from the [AI Developer Hub GitHub repository](https://github.com/ROCm/gpuaidev).

### 2. Install and launch Jupyter[#](#install-and-launch-jupyter)

Inside the Docker container, install Jupyter using the following command:

```
install jupyter
```

Then start the Jupyter server:

```
--ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --no-browser --allow-root
```

**Note**: Ensure port `8888`

is not already in use on your system before running the above command. If it is, you can specify a different port by replacing `--port=8888`

with another port number, for example, `--port=8890`

.

### 3. Provide your Hugging Face token[#](#provide-your-hugging-face-token)

You’ll require a Hugging Face API token to access meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Generate your token at Hugging Face Tokens and request access for [meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct). Tokens typically start with “hf_”.

Run the following interactive block in your Jupyter notebook to set up the token:

**Note**: Uncheck the “Add token as Git credential?” option.

```
from huggingface_hub import notebook_login, HfApi
# Prompt the user to log in
notebook_login()
```

Verify that your token was accepted correctly:

```
# Validate the token
try:
api = HfApi()
user_info = api.whoami()
print(f"Token validated successfully! Logged in as: {user_info['name']}")
except Exception as e:
print(f"Token validation failed. Error: {e}")
```

## Deploying the LLM using vLLM[#](#deploying-the-llm-using-vllm)

Start deploying the LLM (meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) using vLLM in the Jupyter notebook:

### Start the vLLM server[#](#start-the-vllm-server)

Run this command to launch the vLLM server:

```
!HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 python3 -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
--model meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
```

After successfully connecting, it displays `INFO: Uvicorn running on socket ('0.0.0.0', XX) (Press CTRL+C to quit)`

.

**Note**: In a multi-GPU environment, the setting `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=x`

is recommended to deploy the LLM on your preferred GPU.

### Start the client[#](#start-the-client)

After successfully running the server, as described above, open a new notebook and send a query to the server as shown below.

**Note**: For this step, a new Python notebook must be opened. After the notebook cell is created, copy the code below and run it in your new notebook. New notebooks can be opened by selecting **File->New->Notebook**.

```
import requests
url = "http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions"
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
data = {
"model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
"messages": [
{
"role": "system",
"content": "You are an expert in the field of AI. Make sure to provide an explanation in few sentences."
},
{
"role": "user",
"content": "Explain the concept of AI."
}
],
"stream": False,
"max_tokens": 128
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(response.json())
```

If the connection is successful, the output will be:

```
{"id":"chat-xx","object":"chat.completion","created":1736494622,"model":"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct","choices":[{"index":0,"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science ...}
```
