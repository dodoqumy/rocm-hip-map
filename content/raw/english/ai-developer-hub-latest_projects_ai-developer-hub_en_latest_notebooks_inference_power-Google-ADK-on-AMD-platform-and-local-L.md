# AI multi-agents with Google ADK and AMD Instinct GPUs[#](#ai-multi-agents-with-google-adk-and-amd-instinct-gpus)

**Authored by**: [Google](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/intro-a2a-purchasing-concierge) and modified by Shailen Sobhee to run on AMD GPUs.

**Knowledge level**: Intermediate

This tutorial walks you through building a real-world agent-to-agent (A2A) system for a purchasing concierge, where multiple specialized agents (root, burger, and pizza) work together seamlessly.

Here are the agents you’ll be implementing:

**Purchasing agent**: ([Google ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) and [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)) This is the main agent (`root_agent`

), which orchestrates conversations and routes user requests, using LiteLLM with a locally hosted Ollama model.

**Burger seller agent**: ([CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) and vLLM) This agent presents the burger menu, provides pricing, and handles order creation, powered by a vLLM-hosted model.

**Pizza seller agent**: ([LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) and Ollama) This agent specializes in pizza ordering. It’s built with LangGraph on top of Ollama.

The root agent coordinates orders by delegating tasks to the seller agents (pizza and burger) through the open A2A protocol, enabling seamless collaboration across frameworks.

The system runs locally on AMD GPUs and includes an interactive Gradio UI, showcasing real-world agent interoperability and cross-framework integration.

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites)

Use the following setup to run this tutorial.

### Hardware[#](#hardware)

For this tutorial, you need a system with an AMD Instinct™ GPU. To run the model on the CPU and use AMD [ZenDNN](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/zendnn.html), you need an AMD EPYC CPU.

This tutorial was tested on the following hardware:

AMD Instinct MI100

AMD Instinct MI210

AMD Instinct MI300X

4th generation AMD EPYC (Genoa)

5th generation AMD EPYC (Turin)


### Software[#](#software)

**Ubuntu 22.04**: Ensure your system is running Ubuntu 22.04 or later.**ROCm 6.3+**: This is only required for GPU execution. Install and verify ROCm by following the[ROCm installation guide](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/quick-start.html).**PyTorch 2.6**(or later)**vLLM**: For serving the model of your choice in a Docker container (requires`sudo`

rights).**Ollama**: This can be used to serve another model of your choice.

### Install and launch Jupyter Notebooks[#](#install-and-launch-jupyter-notebooks)

If Jupyter is not already installed on your system, install it and launch JupyterLab using the following commands:

```
pip install jupyter
```

To start the Jupyter server, run the following command:

```
jupyter-lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --no-browser --allow-root
```

**Note**: Ensure port `8888`

is not already in use on your system before running the above command. If it is, you can specify a different port by replacing `--port=8888`

with another port number, for example, `--port=8890`

.

After the command executes, the terminal output displays a URL and token. Copy and paste this URL into your web browser on the host machine to access JupyterLab. After launching JupyterLab, upload this notebook to the environment and continue to follow the steps in this tutorial.

## Tutorial overview[#](#tutorial-overview)

This tutorial is divided into five parts, as follows:

**Part 1**: This is an introduction to Agentic AI, covering the basics you’ll need to understand the concepts introduced in the next three parts. This section introduces key concepts like the A2A protocol, agent cards, sessions, and memory, along with the basics of security and authentication.**Part 2**: You’ll build your first agent - the burger seller agent - using CrewAI and see how it functions with an LLM (served by vLLM).**Part 3**: Build your second agent - the pizza seller agent - using LangGraph, with an LLM served by Ollama.**Part 4**: Build your third and final agent - the purchasing concierge agent - with Google ADK and see how all three agents stick together.**Part 5**: Spawn a Gradio UI instance and interact with your purchasing concierge in the GUI.

## Part 1: A quick primer for Agentic AI, Google ADK, and key concepts[#](#part-1-a-quick-primer-for-agentic-ai-google-adk-and-key-concepts)

To create an A2A system, the first thing you need is an *agent*. An agent is a smart computer program designed to act on a person’s behalf, much like a personal assistant. The agents use large language models (LLMs) as their “brain”. The model perceives inputs, reasons with them, and acts to achieve goals.

After an agent, the next component is an *agent card*. This is a simple JSON metadata document that describes the identity, capabilities, and endpoint of the agent. This is like the agent’s “business card”. It tells others who the agent is, what it can do, and how to interact with it. Agent cards are the foundation of how agents discover and talk to each other in the A2A ecosystem.

The *A2A protocol* lets agents communicate and collaborate. This is an open standard that provides a common language for agents built with different frameworks or by different vendors. It introduces two key roles:

**A2A client**: An application or agent that initiates a request on behalf of the user. In this project, the *root agent* (ADK) plays this role when it contacts seller agents.

**A2A server**: An agent or agentic system that exposes an HTTP endpoint to accept requests, process tasks, and return results. In this project, the burger agent (CrewAI) and pizza agent (LangChain) serve as A2A servers.

These agents communicate by exchanging *tasks*. A task is a unit of work made up of multiple messages, for example, placing a burger order.

Together, agents, agent cards, and the A2A protocol (with client and server roles) are the foundation for building interconnected agentic systems. With frameworks like the *Agent Development Kit* (ADK), you can easily create your own agents and connect them into larger ecosystems where a root agent can discover, call, and coordinate remote agents running behind A2A servers.

### How AI agents keep your conversation alive[#](#how-ai-agents-keep-your-conversation-alive)

Just like humans rely on memory to maintain coherent conversations, AI agents need a way to track context across multiple exchanges. Without this capability, each interaction would be an isolated event. Imagine talking to someone who forgets everything the moment after you say it.

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) solves this through three core components:

**Session**: Maintains the current conversation thread and keeps track of the ongoing conversation from start to finish, including every message exchanged and action taken during that specific chat.**State**: Functions as a “scratch pad” for your conversation. It holds temporary data that’s only relevant to your current conversation thread, like items you’ve added to a cart or preferences you’ve currently mentioned. This data gets cleared when the conversation ends.**Memory**: Acts as a searchable knowledge base that spans across all your past sessions, letting the agent recall and reference information or context beyond the current conversation.

These components work together to create agents that can reference previous conversations and build meaningful conversational context over time.

### Security considerations in a multi-agent system[#](#security-considerations-in-a-multi-agent-system)

The A2A protocol is designed with enterprise standards as its core, ensuring agents can collaborate securely and at scale. Instead of new standards, it builds on widely adopted enterprise practices.

**Secure**: All communication happens over HTTPS with modern TLS, certificate validation, and protection against eavesdropping or tampering.**Authentication**: Each agent server enforces authentication using standard web methods (OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and API keys), with credentials passed in HTTP headers and managed outside the protocol.**Authorization**: Enforces granular, skill-based, and least-privilege access controls, ensuring agents only perform permitted actions.**Observability**: Integrates with tracing, logging, and monitoring tools to provide visibility, debugging, and auditing.**API management**: Agent endpoints are discoverable using agent cards, supporting centralized governance and easy onboarding of new agents.

### Notebook preparation[#](#notebook-preparation)

To run this notebook locally, you first need several utilities which include: a definition of the Google A2A types, logic for resolving agent cards, and a few other files for task management. These utility files enable third-party agentic frameworks that are used in this project (for example, CrewAI and LangGraph) to be compatible with the Google A2A protocol.

First, download the utilities and move the cloned files one folder level above so that you can easily use them throughout this tutorial:

```
%%bash
# Define the repository URL and branch
REPO_URL="https://github.com/shailensobhee/google-adk-agentic-ai-tutorial.git"
BRANCH_NAME="utils"
REPO_FOLDER="google-adk-agentic-ai-tutorial"
# Check if the repository folder already exists
if [ -d "$REPO_FOLDER" ]; then
echo "The repository already exists. Updating it..."
cd "$REPO_FOLDER"
git pull origin "$BRANCH_NAME"
else
echo "Cloning the repository for the first time..."
git clone --single-branch --branch "$BRANCH_NAME" "$REPO_URL"
fi
cp -r $REPO_FOLDER/* .
rm -rf $REPO_FOLDER
```

Then install all required Python packages that you will need throughout the rest of the tutorial:

```
!pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

## Part 2: Building the first agent (burger seller) with CrewAI and vLLM[#](#part-2-building-the-first-agent-burger-seller-with-crewai-and-vllm)

This agent is built with CrewAI, and its core LLM is served using vLLM. It presents the burger menu, provides pricing, and handles order creation through the A2A protocol. The standard CrewAI agent structure and definition of the components are as follows:

**agent → task → crew → output**

**Agent**: The specialized entity (role, goal, backstory, tools, or LLM).**Task**: The specific work the agent will perform, with detailed instructions and an expected output format.**Crew**: The orchestrator that links agents and tasks together, defines the process flow, and executes the workflow.

In CrewAI, tasks must always be linked to agents through a crew to run.

Additionally, in this example you’ll create a custom tool, `create_burger_order`

, to handle deterministic order creation. Now you’re ready to implement the burger agent step by step.

### Step 1: Serve a vLLM model[#](#step-1-serve-a-vllm-model)

To start serving a model of your choice using vLLM, you’ll need to run a few commands in a separate terminal. The following steps guide you through the process, which involves running a vLLM Docker container and serving a model with specific configurations for tool-calling agents.

`docker run -d -p 8088:8088 -it --ipc=host --network=host --privileged --cap-add=CAP_SYS_ADMIN --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --device=/dev/mem --group-add render --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined -e HF_TOKEN=$HF_TOKEN --name vllm_server rocm/vllm:latest`


Next, attach to the container using the `docker attach vllm_server`

command.

#### Step 1a: Serve the model with tool-calling capabilities[#](#step-1a-serve-the-model-with-tool-calling-capabilities)

You can serve your model from inside the container. The command provided uses a tool-call parser and a specific chat template, which are crucial for agentic AI applications that require structured function calls.

Export your Hugging Face token to enable access to gated models.

```
export HF_TOKEN=<your HF token>
```

Run the `vllm serve`

command to start the model. This example uses `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`

, but you can replace it with any model you prefer. The following options are added to the command:

`--enable-auto-tool-choice`

: Enables the model to automatically select the appropriate tool.`--tool-call-parser llama3_json`

: Specifies the parser for interpreting tool-calling output, which is crucial for handling structured JSON responses.`--chat-template`

: Points to the specific Jinja template file. This template formats the conversation history in a way that the model understands for generating tool-call responses.

Finally, start the server as follows:

`vllm serve meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \`


`--enable-auto-tool-choice \`


`--tool-call-parser llama3_json \`


`--port 8088 \`


`--chat-template vllm/examples/tool_chat_template_llama3.1_json.jinja`


### Step 2: Set environment variables[#](#step-2-set-environment-variables)

Run the following commands to configure the variables:

```
import os
# Set these to the correct values for your setup
os.environ["VLLM_MODEL"] = "hosted_vllm/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_BASE"] = "http://localhost:8088/v1" # vLLM serve URL
```

### Step 3: Define a tool to create the burger order[#](#step-3-define-a-tool-to-create-the-burger-order)

LLMs are great at deciding what to do, but tools are how they actually perform the action.

The `create_burger_order`

tool turns the model’s intent into a deterministic, auditable action.

The tool takes the burger items the user wants, generates a unique order ID, and builds a clean, structured order.

```
from typing import Literal
from pydantic import BaseModel
import uuid
from crewai.tools import tool
class ResponseFormat(BaseModel):
"""Respond to the user in this format."""
status: Literal["input_required", "completed", "error"] = "input_required"
message: str
class OrderItem(BaseModel):
name: str
quantity: int
price: int
class Order(BaseModel):
order_id: str
status: str
order_items: list[OrderItem]
@tool("create_order")
def create_burger_order(order_items: list[OrderItem]) -> str:
"""
Creates a new burger order with the given order items.
Args:
order_items: List of order items to be added to the order.
Returns:
str: A message indicating that the order has been created.
"""
try:
order_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
order = Order(order_id=order_id, status="created", order_items=order_items)
print("===")
print(f"order created: {order}")
print("===")
except Exception as e:
print(f"Error creating order: {e}")
return f"Error creating order: {e}"
return f"Order {order.model_dump()} has been created"
```

### Step 4: Define the BurgerSellerAgent class[#](#step-4-define-the-burgerselleragent-class)

Recall the standard CrewAI agent structure: agent → task → crew → output.

The `BurgerSellerAgent`

class is essentially a wrapper around the agent–task–crew pipeline. It constructs the agent, task, and crew.

The `BurgerSellerAgent`

class defines the core intelligence and business rules of the burger store agent. It:

Encapsulates the instructions, context, and rules the LLM must follow (menu, pricing, confirmation flow, and error handling).

Connects the LLM (via CrewAI) with the

`create_burger_order`

tool so that order creation is deterministic and safe.Produces a structured response format (

`ResponseFormat`

) that downstream systems (like the A2A server) can reliably consume.Handles different states (

`input_required`

,`error`

,`completed`

) and translates them into a uniform response for the server.Acts as the bridge between user queries and the A2A server, so that the server doesn’t need to know the conversation logic to host the agent.


```
from crewai import Agent as crewagent
from crewai import Crew as crewcrew
from crewai import LLM as crewllm
from crewai import Task as crewtask
from crewai import Process as crewprocess
class BurgerSellerAgent:
TaskInstruction = """
# INSTRUCTIONS

}
```

### Step 5: Start the burger agent A2A server[#](#step-5-start-the-burger-agent-a2a-server)

Now launch the burger agent as an A2A server. This wraps the CrewAI pipeline (agent → task → crew → output) inside the A2A server, so the agent is exposed as a discoverable A2A service.

Running it in a background thread allows the server to:

Continuously listen for incoming requests from other agents (like the root agent).

Keep the Jupyter notebook responsive for further steps.

methods=["GET"],
)
logger.info(f"Starting server on {host}:{port}")
server.start()
except Exception as e:
logger.error(f"An error occurred during server startup: {e}")
exit(1)
```

#### How it works[#](#how-it-works)

It defines the host (

`0.0.0.0`

) and a unique port (`10001`

) for the burger agent. After it starts, the agent is ready to respond to A2A requests from the purchasing agent.

#### Why use a thread?[#](#why-use-a-thread)

Running the server in a background thread means:

You can keep interacting with the notebook

Other agents or client components can still be started in additional cells


This is essential for working with multi-agent systems in an interactive environment like Jupyter.

```
# --- Global variable to hold the server thread reference ---
# This allows you to stop it later from another cell if needed
global server_thread
server_thread = None
# --- Main execution in the Jupyter cell ---
if server_thread is not None and server_thread.is_alive():
print("Server is already running.")
else:
# Define host and port
server_host = "0.0.0.0"
server_port = 10001
# Create and start the thread
server_thread = threading.Thread(target=main, args=(server_host, server_port))
server_thread.daemon = True # Allows the main program to exit even if the thread is still running
server_thread.start()
print(f"Server thread started. Waiting a moment for server to initialize on http://{server_host}:{server_port}")
time.sleep(5) # Give it a few seconds to boot up
```

### Step 6: Test the burger seller agent[#](#step-6-test-the-burger-seller-agent)

Now you can send a sample request to the burger agent endpoint and verify that:

It returns a well-structured response.

The agent offers burger deals.


This confirms the agent is running properly.

```
agent = BurgerSellerAgent()
print(agent)
result = agent.invoke("1 classic cheeseburger pls", "default_session")
print(result)
```

## Part 3: Building the second agent (pizza seller) with LangGraph and Ollama[#](#part-3-building-the-second-agent-pizza-seller-with-langgraph-and-ollama)

This agent is built with LangGraph, and its core LLM is served using Ollama. It presents the pizza menu, provides pricing, and handles order creation through the A2A protocol. LangGraph creates the agent as a ReAct agent graph, implementing a cyclical pattern of reasoning, acting, and observing.

In LangGraph, the ReAct pattern enables all phases of the cycle:

**Reason**: Analyze customer requests and menu options.**Act**: Execute actions by calling appropriate tools.**Observe**: Process the results to provide structured responses.

In this example, you’ll create a custom `create_pizza_order`

tool to handle deterministic order creation.

### Step 1: Serve a model with Ollama[#](#step-1-serve-a-model-with-ollama)

To serve the model, you’ll need to download and install Ollama. To do that, enter these commands in a separate terminal:

```
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama run llama3.1
```

### Step 2: Define the create_pizza_order tool[#](#step-2-define-the-create-pizza-order-tool)

LLMs are great at understanding user intent and figuring out what actions to take, but because they don’t execute those actions themselves, you must use tools.

The `create_pizza_order`

tool takes a list of pizza items the user wants, generates a unique order ID, and builds a structured `Order`

object.

```
from langchain_ollama import ChatOllama
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from typing import Literal

def create_pizza_order(order_items: list[OrderItem]) -> str:
"""

Args:
order_items: List of order items to be added to the order.
Returns:

"""
try:
order_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
order = Order(order_id=order_id, status="created", order_items=order_items)
print("===")
print(f"order created: {order}")
print("===")
except Exception as e:
print(f"Error creating order: {e}")
return f"Error creating order: {e}"
return f"Order {order.model_dump()} has been created"
```

### Step 3: Define the PizzaSellerAgent class[#](#step-3-define-the-pizzaselleragent-class)

As previously mentioned, LangGraph creates the agent as a ReAct agent graph.

The `PizzaSellerAgent`

class is a wrapper around a ReAct graph that constructs the agent. It defines the core intelligence and business rules of the pizza store agent. It does the following:

Encapsulates the instructions, context, and rules the LLM must follow (menu, pricing, confirmation flow, and error handling).

Connects the LLM (using LangChain) with the

`create_pizza_order`

tool so that order creation is deterministic and safe.Produces a structured response format (

`ResponseFormat`

) that downstream systems (like the A2A server) can reliably consume.Handles different states (

`input_required`

) and translates them into a uniform response for the server.Acts as the bridge between user queries and the A2A server, so that the server doesn’t need to know the conversation logic to host the agent.

elif structured_response.status == "completed":
return {

}
return {
"is_task_complete": False,
"require_user_input": True,
"content": "We are unable to process your request at the moment. Please try again.",
}
```

### Step 4: Set environment variables[#](#step-4-set-environment-variables)

Run the following commands to configure the variables:

```
import os
# Set these to the correct values for your setup
os.environ["API_KEY"] = "pizza123"
os.environ["OLLAMA_MODEL"] = "ollama_chat/llama3.1:latest"
os.environ["OLLAMA_BASE_URL"] = "http://localhost:11434"
```

### Step 5: Start the pizza agent server[#](#step-5-start-the-pizza-agent-server)

Now launch the pizza agent as an A2A server. This wraps the agent graph inside the A2AServer, so the agent is exposed as a discoverable A2A service.

```
from utils.server import A2AServer
from utils.a2a_types import AgentCard, AgentCapabilities, AgentSkill, AgentAuthentication
from utils.push_notification_auth import PushNotificationSenderAuth
from utils.task_manager import AgentTaskManager
import click
import logging
import os
import threading
import time
import os
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
def main(host, port):
"""Starts the Pizza Seller Agent server."""
try:
capabilities = AgentCapabilities(pushNotifications=True)
skill = AgentSkill(
id="create_pizza_order",
name="Pizza Order Creation Tool",
description="Helps with creating pizza orders",
tags=["pizza order creation"],
examples=["I want to order 2 pepperoni pizzas"],
)
agent_card = AgentCard(
name="pizza_seller_agent",
description="Helps with creating pizza orders",
# The URL provided here is for the sake of demo,
# in production you should use a proper domain name
url=f"http://{host}:{port}/",
version="1.0.0",
authentication=AgentAuthentication(schemes=["Bearer"]),
defaultInputModes=PizzaSellerAgent.SUPPORTED_CONTENT_TYPES,
defaultOutputModes=PizzaSellerAgent.SUPPORTED_CONTENT_TYPES,
capabilities=capabilities,
skills=[skill],
)
notification_sender_auth = PushNotificationSenderAuth()
notification_sender_auth.generate_jwk()
server = A2AServer(
agent_card=agent_card,
task_manager=AgentTaskManager(
agent=PizzaSellerAgent(),
notification_sender_auth=notification_sender_auth,
),
host=host,
port=port,
api_key=os.environ.get("API_KEY"),
)
server.app.add_route(
"/.well-known/jwks.json",
notification_sender_auth.handle_jwks_endpoint,
methods=["GET"],
)
logger.info(f"Starting server on {host}:{port}")
server.start()
except Exception as e:
logger.error(f"An error occurred during server startup: {e}")
exit(1)
```

#### How it works[#](#id1)

It defines the host (

`0.0.0.0`

) and a unique port (`10000`

) for the pizza agent. After it starts, this agent is ready to respond to A2A requests from the purchasing agent.

#### Why use a thread?[#](#id2)

Running the server in a background thread means:

The server can continuously listen for incoming requests from other agents (like the root agent).

You can keep interacting with the notebook, which remains responsive.

Other agents or client components can still be started in additional cells.


This is essential for working with multi-agent systems in an interactive environment like Jupyter.

```
global server_thread
server_thread = None
# --- Main execution in the Jupyter cell ---
if server_thread is not None and server_thread.is_alive():
print("Server is already running.")
else:
# Define host and port
server_host = "0.0.0.0"
server_port = 10000
# Create and start the thread
server_thread = threading.Thread(target=main, args=(server_host, server_port))
server_thread.daemon = True # Allows the main program to exit even if the thread is still running
server_thread.start()
print(f"Server thread started. Waiting a moment for server to initialize on http://{server_host}:{server_port}")
time.sleep(5) # Give it a few seconds to boot up
```

### Step 6: Test the pizza seller agent[#](#step-6-test-the-pizza-seller-agent)

Now you can send a sample request to the pizza agent endpoint and check that:

It returns a well-structured response.

The agent offers pizza deals.


This confirms the agent is running properly.

```
agent = PizzaSellerAgent()
print(agent)
result = agent.invoke("I want to order 2 pepperoni pizzas", "default_session")
print(result)
```

## Part 4: Building the agent purchasing concierge agent with Google ADK and Ollama[#](#part-4-building-the-agent-purchasing-concierge-agent-with-google-adk-and-ollama)

This agent is built with Google ADK and its core LLM is served using Ollama, It coordinates orders by delegating tasks to these seller agents through the open A2A protocol. You can create the agent in ADK without using Google or Gemini models by using LiteLLM.

### Step 1: Set environment variables[#](#step-1-set-environment-variables)

Run the following commands to configure the variables:

```
import sys
import os
os.environ["OLLAMA_MODEL"] = "ollama_chat/llama3.1:latest"
os.environ["OLLAMA_BASE_URL"] = "http://localhost:11434"
os.environ["PIZZA_SELLER_AGENT_AUTH"] = "pizza123"
os.environ["PIZZA_SELLER_AGENT_URL"] = "http://localhost:10000"
os.environ["BURGER_SELLER_AGENT_AUTH"] = "burgeruser123:burgerpass123"
os.environ["BURGER_SELLER_AGENT_URL"] = "http://localhost:10001"
```

### Step 2: Remote agent connections[#](#step-2-remote-agent-connections)

The root agent delegates tasks to remote agents through the A2A protocol.

The `RemoteAgentConnections`

class is a communication wrapper that manages interactions with remote agents in the A2A ecosystem. It:

Establishes A2A client connections with agent-specific authentication (API keys and basic auth).

Sends tasks to remote agents using the

`send_task()`

method with callback support for real-time updates.Manages metadata propagation and message ID tracking to maintain conversation continuity.

Handles task lifecycle events (status updates and artifact changes) through callback functions.

Maintains session state with conversation context and pending task tracking.


```
from typing import Callable
import uuid
from utils.a2a_types import (
AgentCard,
Task,
TaskSendParams,
TaskStatusUpdateEvent,
TaskArtifactUpdateEvent,
)
from utils.client import A2AClient
import os
TaskCallbackArg = Task | TaskStatusUpdateEvent | TaskArtifactUpdateEvent
TaskUpdateCallback = Callable[[TaskCallbackArg, AgentCard], Task]
KNOWN_AUTH = {
"pizza_seller_agent": os.getenv("PIZZA_SELLER_AGENT_AUTH", "api_key"),
"burger_seller_agent": os.getenv("BURGER_SELLER_AGENT_AUTH", "user:pass"),
}
class RemoteAgentConnections:
"""A class to hold the connections to the remote agents."""
def __init__(self, agent_card: AgentCard, agent_url: str):
auth = KNOWN_AUTH.get(agent_card.name, None)
self.agent_client = A2AClient(agent_card, auth=auth, agent_url=agent_url)
self.card = agent_card
self.conversation_name = None
self.conversation = None
self.pending_tasks = set()
def get_agent(self) -> AgentCard:
return self.card
async def send_task(
self,
request: TaskSendParams,
task_callback: TaskUpdateCallback | None,
) -> Task | None:
response = await self.agent_client.send_task(request.model_dump())
merge_metadata(response.result, request)
# For task status updates, we need to propagate metadata and provide
# a unique message id.
if (
hasattr(response.result, "status")
and hasattr(response.result.status, "message")
and response.result.status.message
):
merge_metadata(response.result.status.message, request.message)
m = response.result.status.message
if not m.metadata:
m.metadata = {}
if "message_id" in m.metadata:
m.metadata["last_message_id"] = m.metadata["message_id"]
m.metadata["message_id"] = str(uuid.uuid4())
if task_callback:
task_callback(response.result, self.card)
return response.result
def merge_metadata(target, source):
if not hasattr(target, "metadata") or not hasattr(source, "metadata"):
return
if target.metadata and source.metadata:
target.metadata.update(source.metadata)
elif source.metadata:
target.metadata = dict(**source.metadata)
```

### Step 3: Define the PurchasingAgent class[#](#step-3-define-the-purchasingagent-class)

As mentioned earlier, you’ll create the agent using LiteLLM, not with the Google or Gemini models.

The `PurchasingAgent`

class is a wrapper around the agent card and agent components. This class defines the core orchestration and delegation logic. It:

Discovers remote agents by resolving agent cards, establishing authenticated connections, and maintaining a seller agent registry.

Orchestrates task delegation through intelligent routing, session management, and asynchronous task handling.

Manages responses by aggregating seller outputs, formatting user messages, and handling state transitions.

Controls conversation flow by tracking agent assignments, managing metadata propagation, and coordinating multi-agent interactions.

Provides reliability through error handling, clean session management, and structured response validation.

Execution:

- When the remote agent is repeatedly asking for user confirmation, assume that the remote agent doesn't have access to user's conversation context.
So improve the task description to include all the necessary information related to that agent
- Never ask user permission when you want to connect with remote agents. If you need to make connection with multiple remote agents, directly
connect with them without asking user permission or asking user preference
- Always show the detailed response information from the seller agent and propagate it properly to the user.
- If the remote seller is asking for confirmation, rely the confirmation question to the user if the user haven't do so.
- If the user already confirmed the related order in the past conversation history, you can confirm on behalf of the user
- Do not give irrelevant context to remote seller agent. For example, ordered pizza item is not relevant for the burger seller agent
- Never ask order confirmation to the remote seller agent
Please rely on tools to address the request, and don't make up the response. If you are not sure, please ask the user for more details.

## Part 5: Running the purchasing concierge agent from a UI[#](#part-5-running-the-purchasing-concierge-agent-from-a-ui)

To make it easier to test the agent, you can build a simple Gradio interface. It runs locally in your browser at `http://localhost:8095`

.

Now try it out by asking for a menu! After all the agents are running, you can test their responses by asking:

“What is your pizza menu today?”


or

“Please give me a list of burgers and pizzas you have, including prices in bullet points”


Each seller agent (burger and pizza) will reply with their available items and prices.

This is a great way to test if the agents are reachable and responding properly and is helpful for testing how the full multi-agent system works.
